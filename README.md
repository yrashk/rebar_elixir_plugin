## rebar_elixir_plugin

This plugin allows you to compile Elixir files in your Erlang projects using Rebar.

## Installation

To install this plugin, you need to add it as a dependency to your rebar application:

    {deps, [{ rebar_elixir_plugin, ".*",
             {git, "git://github.com/yrashk/rebar_elixir_plugin"}}]}.
    
    %% Let rebar know about the new plugins
    {plugins, [rebar_elixir_compiler, rebar_exunit] }.

This plugin depends on Elixir too, so you need to add it as a rebar dependency:

    {deps, [{ elixir, "0.8.*",
             {git, "git://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir"}}]}.

Elixir is structured similarly to Erlang's OTP. It is divided into applications that are placed inside the `lib` directory, as seen on its [source code repository](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir). We need to explicitly tell rebar so:

    {lib_dirs, [
      "deps/elixir/lib"
    ]}.

This should be all.

## Available configuration

* `ex_first_files` - first elixir files to be configured;
* `src_dirs` - where to find elixir source;
* `ex_opts` - elixir compilation options: `ignore_module_conflict` (default to true), `docs` (default to false) and `debug_info` (default to false);
